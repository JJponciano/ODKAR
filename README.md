# ODKATON: Ontology-based Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition and Automated Reasoning using NLP, OWL, and SWRL

## ðŸ¥³ HONORABLE MENTION at [WEBIST2024](https://webist.scitevents.org/?y=2024)

ODKATON is an ontology-driven system designed for dynamic knowledge acquisition and automated reasoning using Natural Language Processing (NLP), OWL ontologies, and SWRL rules. It offers an automated pipeline that converts natural language text into formal ontologies, enabling real-time reasoning and advanced rule-based inference. This repository contains the official implementation of ODKATON, including the ontologies generated by different approaches (Proposed Approach, ChatGPT, and Expert) and the codebase.

## Overview
ODKATON addresses the need for an NLP-driven system that transforms unstructured text into formal OWL ontologies, supporting automated reasoning through SWRL rules. It minimizes the need for manual intervention, making ontology generation more accessible and scalable for diverse applications.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extracts entities and relationships from unstructured text.
- **Ontology Mapping**: Maps extracted data to OWL classes, properties, and individuals.
- **Automated Reasoning**: Implements reasoning using SWRL rules for dynamic knowledge inference.
- **Multiple Ontologies**: Includes ontologies generated by various approaches (Proposed, ChatGPT, and Expert).

## To-Do List

### Completed Tasks
- âœ… **Release of Ontologies**: The three ontologies (Proposed Approach, ChatGPT, and Expert) are available.

### Upcoming Tasks
- â¬œ **Release the Code**: The code for ODKATON, including the NLP pipeline, ontology mapping, and reasoning engine, will be released soon.
- â¬œ **Detailed Instructions**: Add more detailed installation and usage instructions.
- â¬œ **Test Cases**: Provide test cases and examples to demonstrate the usage of the system.
- â¬œ **Automated Reasoning Demos**: Include demos showcasing the SWRL-based reasoning in action.
- â¬œ **API Integration**: Add a simple API to interact with the system programmatically.

## Installation
The installation process will be added when the code is released.

## Usage
Usage instructions for running ODKATON and using the ontologies will be included with the code release.
